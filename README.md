Simple web interface for relational database in PHP

Written in May 2016 for Databases 1 course at Warsaw University of Technology.

Very simple MVC-based PHP interface with some additional features in jQuery and standard Bootstrap-based design. Works with the database provided in onlineshop.sql file. The app allows user to add and remove clients and items in the online shop. May be useful as a base for some bigger project. 

Comments are in Polish, I'm too lazy to translate them. Sorry.
